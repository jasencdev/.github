## Hi there 👋

Welcome to the GitHub profile of [jasenc.dev](https://jasenc.dev/), an organization setup by [Jasen Carroll](https://github.com/jasencarroll) to differentiate random pursuits of software development from professional displays of work. This is a portfolio of projects collected from various sources or developed in conjunction with bootcamps and educational adventures. 

📚 Learning & Collaboration
I'll cite the books and institutions accordingly in case you're interested in learning more. Many of the public repositories here are designed to act as tutorials for learners and developers. If you're following along and notice an omission, have questions, or want to contribute, please don't hesitate to reach out!

🚀 Happy coding!
